# Basic Descriptive Statistics  
## Description  
Today you will be working to model basic statistics using Python. As we currently know limited functionality, we will be sticking with basic statistic measurements for now. Please read all instructions carefully.  

## Instructions  
### Part One - Basic Statistics
1. Accept input from the user five times in the form of an integer.
   1. You should have five total variables.
   2. Be sure that your prompts are correctly filled in.
2. Using these five variables accomplish the following:
   1. Find the maximum number of the five variables.
   2. Find the minimum number of the five variables.
   3. Find the mean of the five variables.
   4. Find the range from the max to the minimum of the five variables.
   5. HARD: Find the median of the five variables.

Note: You may not use any built-in function that will give you one of the targets listed above. This means you may not use the `max()` and `min()` functions, or the statistics module. When finding the median, try to think out of the box.

### Part Two
The quadratic equation is utilized in order to find roots of an equation in the form of the following: ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0.
1. Accept input from the user in the form of three numbers: a, b, and c.
2. Calculate both roots of the quadratic equation, and output these to the user. Be sure to specify which of these is which.

### Part Three
Using String duplication (multiplication), print the following patterns to the terminal:

Note that Markdown may display the patterns incorrectly. Please look at the source text for this file for the actual pattern.  

Pattern 1:

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&  
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&  
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&  
&&&&&&
